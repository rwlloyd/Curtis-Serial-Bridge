SPEED SYSTEM

The vechiicles own controller takes a voltage input between 0 ans 5V.
2.26V is about the center of this and means velocity 0.
Above this means forward, to 5V max
Below it means reverse, to 0V min.

Note for safety: if all systems go down and put 0V here, it will reverse at full speed which is danergous unless another low level system monitors and cuts the power off!

We send voltages to the vehicles controller using Polulu.
The Arduino's serial input takes ints, call them speed bytes. (as they are in 1 byte range 0-255)
The ints are multiplied by alpha to become analog volts out.
alpha is different for diffent LAPTOPs because their USBs send different voltages to the Arduino power.
	in theory this should be V_max=5V
	but can be a bit less eg. V_max=4.97V
	alpha is set such that
		4096*alpha = V_max

For toughbook, V_max is about 4.97V.  For Chris laptop is is closer to 5V.
The reqwuired control voltages do not change between laptops, but the speedbytes do.



LOG FILES
are at ~/.ros/log/



MECHANICAL
TODO need a bracket like this to mount actuator more securely  https://www.pololu.com/product/2308
TODO deadmans handle into ignition switch
TODO granny mode - vehicle own controller has a switch that slows down all speed change requests, but can be disabled, in some docs somewhere




LIDAR


INSTALL
velodyne has http config page at http://192.168.1.201/
lidar package is installed 9n catkin_ws/velodyne
(from standard tutorial wiki.ros.ros/velodyne/Tutorials - Getting started with the velodyne VLP16)
http://wiki.ros.org/velodyne/Tutorials/Getting%20Started%20with%20the%20Velodyne%20VLP16


RUNNING
must be on wired ethernet -- not wifi (can jump to wifi sometimes?)
roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points.launch

rostopic echo /velodyne_points
rosrun rviz rviz -f velodyne

In the "displays" panel, click "Add", then select "Point Cloud2", then press "OK".
In the "Topic" field of the new "Point Cloud2" tab, enter "/velodyne_points".
